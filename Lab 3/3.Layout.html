            <h2>Why Fitness is My Foundation</h2>
            <p>
                Fitness isn't about flexing in the mirror. It's discipline. It's self-respect.
                Every rep, whether it's gym or calisthenics, is a reminder that consistency wins.
                A strong body is just the byproduct—a strong mind is the real reward.

            <h2>Psychology of Comebacks</h2>
            <p>
                Comebacks aren't about grinding harder. They're about staying sharp, 
                controlling your emotions, and playing the long game. Master your mind, 
                delay the cheap rewards, stay calm when pressure peaks—that's what
                separates the ones who rise from the ones who fold.

            <h2>Why I Love Nature</h2>
            <p>
                Grassy fields, waterfalls, mountains—the purity of nature always resets my mind. 
                Like in <i>Vinland Saga</i>, the contrast of icy cold lands and sunny meadows 
                reflects life itself. Silence in nature speaks louder than noise in cities.

            <h2>Building Fluency in English</h2>
            <p>
                Communication is power. I've realized fluency isn't about knowing big words—it's 
                about clarity, presence, and confidence. Speaking slowly, thinking in English, and 
                daily practice are turning my weakness into strength.
